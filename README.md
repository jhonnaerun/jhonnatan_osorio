# ProductsApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.14.

## Development server

Before starting the application, make sure the backend server is running and CORS are enabled.

To enable CORS, install the package in the backend project:

```bash
npm i cors

Then configure CORS in the main.ts file:

cors: {
  origin: '*',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true,
},

After that, install the frontend dependencies and start the development server:

npm i
ng s -o
